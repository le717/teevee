# [TEE VEE HERE](http://le717.github.io/teevee) #

In the 2000 Strategy PC video game [LEGO&reg; LEGO Apha Team](http://en.brickimedia.org/wiki/LEGO_Alpha_Team), when the game is run on Windows X
computers, a [very](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1Ja_QIX55E) [well](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3hlwmpQq1g)
[documented](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySniIhppmRg) and sometimes [annoyingly humorous](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39dN4oT60Rs) audio glitch
occurs where one of Tee Vee's (the mission giver) audio clips will become stuck in an endless loop, crippling all game play unless both music and sound
effects are disabled. As my 2014 April Fool's joke, **TEE VEE HERE** recreates this audio glitch in an HTMl5 webpage, allowing Tee Vee's everlasting
annoyingness to go everywhere! :smile:
